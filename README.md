# Aethor auto responder repo

This repository hosts all responders for discord servers mapped by server id's.

if you notice any typo's or feel the need to create additional auto responders
make a pull request.

## Contributing

Want to add responders for a certain server you are staff in? just fork the repo
and and create a file in `data/` with the responders you can look at other
responders for examples. I would also like proof of you being staff in the
server your're adding responders for.
